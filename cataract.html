                <h2>Understanding Cataracts</h2>
                <p>Cataracts are a condition where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, leading to blurry vision. This is a common cause of vision loss, especially in older adults. Cataracts can occur in one or both eyes and may lead to difficulty in seeing clearly, especially in low light or while reading.</p>
                <p>Early detection of cataracts is crucial for preventing vision impairment. AI models, especially those trained on large datasets of eye images, can help in identifying cataracts at an early stage, even before symptoms appear.</p>
