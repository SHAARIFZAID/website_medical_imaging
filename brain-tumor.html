                <h2>Understanding Brain Tumors</h2>
                <p>Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can either be malignant (cancerous) or benign. Early detection is key to effective treatment. A tumor's size, location, and type are critical in determining treatment and prognosis. Brain tumors can cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, seizures, and changes in cognitive function.</p>
                <p>Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy. These models have been trained on vast datasets of medical images and can recognize patterns that might be difficult for human doctors to detect.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Speed</h3>
                        <p>AI detects tumors in seconds, much faster than manual interpretation, allowing for timely intervention and reducing patient waiting times.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                        <p>AI models achieve up to 95% accuracy in detecting tumors from MRI scans, helping doctors make more reliable diagnoses.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Precision</h3>
                        <p>AI reduces human error, ensuring that results are consistent and minimizing the risk of misdiagnosis.</p>
